# Flood Data Ecosystem - Odisha
The repository contains codes to extract relevant datasets and the modelling approach used to calculate Risk Scores for Odisha.



Data that could enable more effective disaster-risk response and management is scattered or siloed across different agencies, at different scales and formats, making it difficult for decision-makers and relevant stakeholders to make data-informed decisions. The availability of good quality, machine-readable, and interoperable data is crucial for effective climate action and disaster response. However, in India, this data is fragmented and siloed, scattered across different agencies, making it difficult for decision-makers to make data-informed decisions in a timely manner.

We have developed a data model for combining climate, losses & damages, procurement and demographic data for effective flood mitigation strategies in Assam state. Our solution leverages advanced data science techniques to derive insights for decision makers and make it into a user-friendly, interactive open-access tool.
