# BHUVAN Disaster Services
BHUVAN Disaster Services provides inundation maps of various flood events in India. Check this [link](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/disaster/disaster.php?id=flood) to explore the data source.

**Variables extracted from the source:**

1. `inundation_pct`: Percentage of pixels that are inundated atleast once in a revenue circle in a month
2. `intensity_mean`: Mean intensity of inundation in a revenue circle in a month. Intensity is the number of times a pixel is inundated in a month divided by the maximum number of times a pixel is inundated in the given month.
3.  `intensity_sum`: Sum intensity of inundation in a revenue circle in a month. Intensity is the number of times a pixel is inundated in a month divided by the maximum number of times a pixel is inundated in the given month.


## Folder Structure

- `data`: Contains datasets generated using the scripts.
    - `tiffs`: Contains flood inundation maps of a given day after geo-referencing. The tiffs are of resolution 0.0001716660336923202072 -0.0001716684356881450775 in degrees.
        - `removed_watermarks`: Flood inundation tiffs without BHUVAN watermark. Watermarks disturb image processing and further analytics.
        - `stitched_monthly`: All inundation images of a month are summed together to produce a single flood inundation map for a month. More the pixel value, more that pixel was inundated in that particular month.


- `scripts` : Contains the scripts used to obtain the data
    - `get_dates.py`: Scrapes the BHUVAN portal to get all the dates on which the flood inundation maps are available for Assam
    - `gdal_wms.py`: Downloads the compressed inundation map for chosen dates from BHUVAN WMS layer in `.tif` format
    - `remove_watermark.py`: Removed `bhuvn` watermarks from the inundation maps downloaded
    - `transformer.py`: Stitches the inundation maps and creates the required variables for a chosen month
    - `upload_to_s3.py`: Uploads the individual flood inundation maps to S3 for archival
